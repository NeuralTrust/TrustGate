                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your
programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these freedoms or asking you to surrender the freedoms. Therefore, you
have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software,
or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that
you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

  Developers that use the GNU General Public License protect your rights
with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you
this License, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or
modify the software.

  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.

  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting
users' freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such
abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is
precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this
version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such
problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend
this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as
needed to protect the freedom of users.

  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

   “This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

   “Copyright”
       means copyright-like laws that apply to both
       software and other kinds of works that this License covers.

   “The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed
   under this License.

   “A covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work based
   on the Program (in which case the resulting work is called a “modified
   version” of the Program). 

   To “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
   in a manner requiring permission under applicable copyright law. The
   resulting work is called a “modified version” of the earlier work or a work
   “based on” the earlier work.

   The “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for
   making modifications to it. The “object code” means any non-source form of a work.

   A “Standard Interface” means an interface that is defined by a well-known
   or widely used specification and is used as a public interface by the work.

   The “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything, other than
   the work as a whole, that (a) is included in a typical installation of the
   operating system for which the work is designed, and (b) is
   considered necessary to run the work (for example, standard components of the
   operating system).

   The “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all the
   source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work)
   run the object code and to modify the work, including the scripts used to
   control those activities. However, it does not include the work's System
   Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs
   which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not
   part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface
   definition files associated with the work's source files and the source
   code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work
   is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication
   or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.

   The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate
   automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.

  1. Source Code.

   The “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
   modifications to it. The “object code” means any non-source form of the work.

  2. Basic Permissions.

   All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on
   the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This
   License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified
   Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only
   if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License
   acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by
   applicable law.

   You may make, run, and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without
   conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey
   covered works to others for the sole purpose of establishing copyright
   ownership or as a consequence of a transfer of rights, provided that you do not
   impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted
   herein.

  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

   No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure
   under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under international treaties.
   When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
   circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is
   effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered
   work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the
   work as a means of enforcing, against the work itself, your or third parties'
   legal rights to prohibit circumvention of technological measures.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

   You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it,
   in any medium, provided that you convey the License and keep intact all
   copyright notices. You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring
   a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

   You may convey a work based on the Program, or a modification of the Program,
   in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also
   meet all of these conditions:

       a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it,
          and giving a relevant date.

       b) The work must be licensed as a whole under this License to anyone who
          comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along
          with any additional terms specified in section 7, to the entire work, and all
          its parts, regardless of how they are packaged.
       
       c) If the work has interactive interfaces, each must display Appropriate
          Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do
          not display such notices, this requirement does not apply.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

   You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4
   and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under
   the terms of this License, in one of these ways:

       a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a
          physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed
          on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.

       b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product, accompanied by a
          written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer
          spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who
          possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all
          the software in the product that is covered by this License, or (2) access to
          copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

       c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of a written offer to
          provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally
          and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer,
          in accord with this License.

       d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for
          a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same
          manner through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients
          to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the
          object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server
          (operated by you or a third party) provided that you give clear directions for obtaining it.

       e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided that you inform
          other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being made
          available to the general public at a free-of-charge rate.

   A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the
   Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object
   code work.

  7. Additional Terms.

   “Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making
   exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable
   to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the
   extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to
   part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the
   entire work remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.

   When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may, at your option, remove any additional
   permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written
   to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place
   additional permissions on material added by you to a covered work for which you have or may give
   the appropriate copyright permission.

  8. Termination.

   You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this
   License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically
   terminate your rights under this License (including any rights granted under section 8) from
   that point on. However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your rights under
   this License may be reinstated (a) provisionally, pending the review of further compliance
   with this License, or (b) permanently, if certain conditions are met.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

   You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program.
   Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a result of using peer-to-peer
   transmission to receive a copy does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than
   this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions
   infringe copyright if you do not accept this License.

  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

   Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from
   the original licensors to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to the terms of this
   License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

  11. Patents.

   A “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program
   or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus qualifies as a contributor version.
   Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the
   contributor's licensed patents, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run,
   modify and propagate the work, subject to the terms of this License. If you institute patent
   litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) against any party alleging
   that the covered work or a contribution to it constitutes direct or contributory patent
   infringement, then any patent licenses granted to you under this License for that covered work
   shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

   If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that
   contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this
   License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy concurrently your obligations under
   this License and any other pertinent obligations, then you may not convey it at all.

  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any
   covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a
   single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to
   apply to the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License
   will apply to the combination as such.

  14. Revised Versions of this License.

   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public
   License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
   but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. Each version is given a
   distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the
   GNU General Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of following
   the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that you
   have received, or subsequently receive, in writing.

  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

   THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
   EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING, THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
   PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
   INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS
   FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the program
   is with you. Should the program prove defective, you assume the cost of all necessary servicing,
   repair or correction.

  16. Limitation of Liability.

   IN NO EVENT, UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING, SHALL ANY COPYRIGHT
   HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE
   TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
   ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
   DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE
   OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN
   ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

   If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be
   given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local
   law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with
   the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program
   in return for a fee.

                    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

 If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use,
 the best way to achieve this is to make it free software, released under the GNU General
 Public License. To do so, attach the following notices to your program. It is safest to
 attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of
 warranty; and each file should have at least the “copyright” line and a pointer to where
 the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>
    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of
    the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3
    of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY;
    without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
    See the GNU General Public License for more details.
